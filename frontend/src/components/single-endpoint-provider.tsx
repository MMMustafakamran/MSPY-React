/**
 * Provider for `/intelligence/quickstart`, nested inside the app-wide
 * `Providers`.
 *
 * This is the Intelligence Quickstart's "Use the single-route frontend
 * transport" step: `runtimeUrl` plus a bare `useSingleEndpoint`. Everywhere
 * else in this repo the flag is pinned to `false`, because `quickstart` and
 * `copilot-runtime` still publish the multi-route runtime and
 * `useSingleEndpoint={false}` alongside it. This one route is the only place
 * the new guidance applies.
 *
 * `useSingleEndpoint` with no value is `true`, which sets the core's transport
 * to `"single"`: every request becomes a POST of `{ method, params, body }` at
 * the bare `runtimeUrl`, instead of a REST call against the runtime subtree.
 * Leaving the prop off entirely would select `"auto"`, which probes REST first
 * and would therefore not exercise the doc's step at all.
 *
 * `headers` forwards the same bearer token the root provider sends, because
 * `backend/main.py` rejects unauthenticated AG-UI calls whenever
 * `AUTH_BEARER_TOKEN` is set.
