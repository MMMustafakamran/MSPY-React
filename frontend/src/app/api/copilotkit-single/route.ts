/**
 * The Intelligence Quickstart's "Expose one Runtime route" step, verbatim.
 *
 * The page used to mount the multi-route handler at
 * `app/api/copilotkit/[[...slug]]/route.ts` and export four verbs. As of the
 * 2026-09-09 sync it mounts the single-route handler at a plain
 * `app/api/copilotkit/route.ts` and exports only `POST`, so that is what this
 * file is: a plain `route.ts`, `mode: "single-route"`, one export.
 *
 * It is a third mount rather than a rewrite of an existing one. `/api/copilotkit`
 * is still what `quickstart` and `copilot-runtime` publish — both of those pages
 * continue to show `[[...slug]]`, `GET` + `POST`, and
 * `useSingleEndpoint={false}` — and `/api/copilotkit-threads` is the multi-route
 * mount the Rich Threads pages need. Rewriting either would have put this repo
 * out of sync with the pages that did not change.
 *
 * The runtime handed to it is the same `createIntelligenceRuntime()` the threads
 * mount uses, so the only variable between the two endpoints is the transport.
 *
 * What this mount can and cannot answer at @copilotkit/runtime 1.69.2 is
 * recorded on `/intelligence/quickstart`; the short version is that
 * `single-route-helpers` accepts exactly seven envelope methods and none of them
 * is a thread, memory, or annotation method.
